 conservative_resources_2:0 "Land Tenure"
 conservative_resources_2_desc:0 "The institution of the first legal system of permenant land ownership encourages owners to thuroughly survey their land for resources and cultivate it to its greatest extent, since they are guaranteed to reap the benefit."
 conservative_education_2:0 "Erudite Clergy"
 conservative_education_2_desc:0 "As religious institutions grow in wealth and power, they find themselves in need of more and more clergymen, almost all of whom come from noble backgrounds, so they invest in more and more schools to train them, leading to a boom in the educated population and a decrease in the number of people supported by noble taxes."
 reform_3:0 "Proto-Industrialization"
 reform_3_desc:0 "A sudden inovation, the steam engine, leads to both a vast increase in the efficiency of most production and the ability to miniaturize industries that used to require many more people and much more land."

 reform_5:0 "Industrial Revolution"
 reform_5_desc:0 "Improvements on the steam engine turn it from a tool for the very wealthy into a machine that can be placed in almost every tool, workshop, and vehicle, creating the largest expansion yet in production."
 basic_construction:0 "Engineering"
 basic_construction_desc:0 "The application of scientific principles to the design and construction of structures and tools is fundamental"
 construction_l1:0 "Packed Clay"
 construction_l1_desc:0 "The first long term structures in history are made out of clay dug from the river bank, pressed into thick layers, and allowed to dry. These new buildings are more permanent and abundant than the animal skin tents of old."
 construction_r1:0 "Timber Frames"
 construction_r1_desc:0 "Poles cut from trees that line the riverbanks are used to stabilize the clay houses as they dry. This frees up material that is not wasted when houses colapse to repair other buildings."
 repair_1:0 "Thatched Roofs"
 repair_1_desc:0 "The use of straw produced as waste from agricultural production makes building both cheaper and easier, since thatch is light weight and only needs to be replaced every few years." 
 construction_l2:0 "Rudimentary Brickmaking"
 construction_l2_desc:0 "A new method of construction involving pouring mud into a latice of wood slats and leaving them in the sun to dry and harden into bricks leads to drastic improvements in the speed of construction and durability of buildings."
 construction_r2:0 "Masonry"
 construction_r2_desc:0 "Economic specialization gives rise to a new group of professional benders whose job is to build and repair buildings and are on hand on a regular basis, rather than having to wait for an off season to make repairs to buildings."
 repair_2:0 "Mortar"
 repair_2_desc:0 "Quick drying mortar developed by the new class of masons makes repairs faster and easier. Mortar can even be stored in clay jars on site so that owners can make their own minor repairs if a mason is not readily available."
 construction_l3:0 "Cut Stone"
 construction_l3_desc:0 "Hardened stone tools allow masons to start carving stone building blocks directly out of cliffsides and mointains. While these stones do not fully replace mud bricks as the most common buidling material, they do make certain key buidlings significantly more stable."
 construction_r3:0 "Metal Drills"
 construction_r3_desc:0 "Using rudimentary bronze drills, masons can now detatch larger blocks of stone by drilling holes that are then expanded into cracks using wooden wedges. Fewer of these larger blocks are needed to finish buildings."
 repair_3:0 "Wooden Sledges"
 repair_3_desc:0 "Using draft animals, larger and larger blocks of cut stone can be transported longer and longer distances in shorter and shorter periods of time, drasrtically improving repair times."
 construction_l4:0 "Fired Brick"
 construction_l4_desc:0 "As hard as stone, but much easier to transport, fired brick marries the ease of contstruction with mud bricks and the sturdiness of stone construction by using clay ovens to bring bricks to much hotter temperatures than their sun dried predecessors."
 construction_r4:0 "Arched Roofs"
 construction_r4_desc:0 "The development of arched roofs, made possible by the much smaller fired bricks, allow buildings to be built entirely of one material and cuts out the need for waiting until harvest time for thatch to finish a roof."
 repair_4:0 "Lime Mortar"
 repair_4_desc:0 "By incorporating crushed limestone into mortar, the mortar both lasts longer and has a stronger binding effect, making repairs both less necessary and cheaper."
 construction_l5:0 "Standardized Brickmaking"
 construction_l5_desc:0 "Official state monopolization of brickmaking standardizes size, shape, and process. New buildings can now be constructed in the exact size and shape, so fewer locations are wasted on failed projects due to missing materials."
 construction_r5:0 "Concrete"
 construction_r5_desc:0 "When the newly invented cement is mixed with smaller stones and bits of crushed brick it sets into a stone like substance that can be used to fit into spaces for which bricks can not easily be made or stones can not easily be cut." 
 repair_5:0 "Cement"
 repair_5_desc:0 "Adding volcanic ash to lime mortar makes it set much faster and even underwater. Construction and repairs can now procede even in rain and in areas that do not recieve direct sunlight."   
 construction_l6:0 "Geometric Design"
 construction_l6_desc:0 "A new specialty field called architecture emerges that allows builders to use sketches and designs to plan a building before it is constructed. Buildings grow taller and wider as a result."
 construction_r6:0 "Timber Construction"
 construction_r6_desc:0 "While not as strong or long lasting as stone structures, timber buildings, made possbile by stronger metal tools, are cheaper and much easier to assemble."
 repair_6:0 "Jointed Construction"
 repair_6_desc:0 "Stacking bricks in an offset pattern, rather than one on top of the other, means that when cracks form in the building, they are not able to run the length of the structure and repairs only need to be made to inch long cracks, rather than entire walls."
 construction_l7:0 "Scaffolding"
 construction_l7_desc:0 "The use of wooden beams both internall and externally allows for even larger buildings, which can house more and more manufacturing materials and workers."
 construction_r7:0 "Domed Roofs"
 construction_r7_desc:0 "Arches have long been used to stabilize doorways and underground rooms, but the inovation of fully circular domes expands further the stability of roofs and cuts down on construction time used to stabilize structures."
 repair_7:0 "Blown Glass"
 repair_7_desc:0 "Standardized glass blowing by artisans allows windows, which up until this point were either filled with translucent stone or less sturdy poured glass, to be mass produced, making them easily replaceable."
 construction_l8:0 "Steel Supports"
 construction_l8_desc:0 "With the mass production of steel, the skelatons of buildings can now be made of metal and they can now be build much wider without sacrificing structural integrity."
 basic_production:0 "Hand Tool Production"
 basic_production_desc:0 "There is only as much as an individual can achieve using only raw materials and his bare hands, however by assembling tools, one can use these to greatly improve the effectivness of the creation of even more advanced tools, and also weapons."
 production_1:0 "Copper casting"
 production_1_desc:0 "With innovations in investment casting, we are able to build tools made out of metals such as the easily available copper ore, these tools are more durable and easier to repair when damaged when compared to their predecessors."
 naval_1:0 "Early Ships"
 naval_1_desc:0 "Tents are made by lashing animal skins together using tendons, so why not wood? The first naval vessels are made by drilling small holes in wood and tying them together using leather straps."
 production_2:0 "Bronze Alloy"
 production_2_desc:0 "The exploitation of copper and tin outcroppings above ground lead to the discovery of a new alloy we call bronze, this metal makes tools and weapons more durable than mere copper, so each weapon produced is worth considerably more than before."
 naval_2:0 "Pitch Construction"
 naval_2_desc:0 "By replacing leather straps with pitch, ships become even more water tight. The newly assembled ships are both cheaper, since one barrel of pitch is easier to collect than several animal hides."
 production_3:0 "Iron Forging"
 production_3_desc:0 "The use of bronze tools to dig shallow mines exposes iron, which when worked into tools and weapons, proves even stronger than the bronze alloys and far more resistant to bending and damage."
 naval_3:0 "Wind Propulsion"
 naval_3_desc:0 "Up until now all ships have been propelled by either oars or polls, but using newly flexible cloth as a sail, ships can now travel greater distances and do not require nearly as much wood to produce."
 production_4:0 "Standardized Weaponry"
 production_4_desc:0 "Larger civilizations require larger armies. Each civilization settles on a length of sword, number of spear prongs, and number of arrow barbs, allowing for mass production of weapons to arm their new armies."
 naval_4:0 "Decks and Rudders"
 naval_4_desc:0 "Technological inovations in naval warfare evolve rapidly. Shipwrights learn farily quickly that multiple decks on a ship afford more protection from incoming fire and rear rudders make for much more efficient steering."
 production_5:0 "Steel Production"
 production_5_desc:0 "Steel, once a rare and prized metal found only very rarely through the efforts of master benders, is now manufactured, albeit slowly, by manually mixing coal and iron in the smelting process."
 naval_5:0 "Shipwright Guilds"
 naval_5_desc:0 "Guild members have access to vast troves of accumulated knowledge regarding ship construction and design. The formation of these new guilds increases the efficiency of ship construction by quickly disseminating this new information."
 production_6:0 "Commercialization"
 production_6_desc:0 "The broad appeal of iron based products leads to a swift increase in the number of iron manufactuaries. This new private sector of iron smelting increasese the general knowledge base of ironworking and the number of people capabale of forging new weapons."
 naval_6:0  "Iron Reinforcement"
 naval_6_desc:0 "The addition of iron bands to wooden ships makes them far less vulnerable to cracking from conventional weaponry and far more durable when compared to their unreinforced predecessors."
 production_7:0 "Replaceable Parts"
 production_7_desc:0 "As production speeds up, it is quickly realized that rather than making entire weapons in one go, constituate parts can be standardized and produced separately to be assemble later."
 naval_7:0 "Ironclad"
 naval_7_desc:0 "The newly cheap steel and the practice of iron reinforcement lead to a natural conclusion: steel ships. Current wooden ships are clad in steel, but new ships are produced entirely in steel, yet they are cheaper than having to chop down an entire forest for one ship."
 basic_gathering:0 "Logging Axes"
 basic_gathering_desc:0 "We cannot prepetually rely on fallen branches and dead logs, to fulfuill our construction needs we require entire trees to be felled, and for that reason we require tools cappable of such task."
 wood_1:0 "Bronze Axes"
 wood_1_desc:0 "A significant improvement over their copper predecessors, bronze axes not only prove to be more resiliant, but also easier to repair."
 stone_1:0 "Stone Knapping"
 stone_1_desc:0 "No longer do we need to rely on finding already half-formed arrowheads and stone ax blades. Now whole stones can be shaped into whatever tools are needed."
 storage_1:0 "Clay Pottery"
 storage_1_desc:0 "The use of large stone jars has long been possible in the earth kingdom, but the evolution of clay pottery makes storage possbile even for those who are not benders. Granaries can now be built virtually everywhere."
 farming_1:0 "Agriculture"
 farming_1_desc:0 "The tribe increased in number and we cannot afford to live of hunting and gathering anymore, it has been known that seeds grow into plants for a long time, so we should use this process in order to grow our own food, instead of hoping for nature to grow it for us."
 food_1:0 "Cultivation"
 food_1_desc:0 "A stable food source established, certain members of the tribe begin spending more time in and amongst the crops. Soon they learn that there are some stands that produce more than others. In the next growing season, they are sure to replant only those strands."
 tanning_1:0 "Animal Husbandry"
 tanning_1_desc:0 "The abundance of grain attracts an abundance of animals. Certain game animals that were formerly hunted are now drawn to settlements to eat the leftover waste products from farming. When the skins of these newly docile animals are left out in the sun long enough some can be used for tents."
 mining_1:0 "Surface Mining"
 mining_1_desc:0 "Some of the new settlements are not only close to stands of grain. The longer one tribe stays in one place, the more outcroppings of useful metals they seem to discover."
 mining_c1:0 "Lignite"
 mining_c1_desc:0 "Coal was only very rarely found above ground, and even then there was only ever enough for painting and drawing. Once mining moved underground, however, large seems could be exploited to drive industrial progress."
 textile_1:0 "Homespun Cloth"
 textile_1_desc:0 "Some societies use wool, others reeds, and still others flax, but no matter the material, all begin to use the newly abundant materials around them to create new, more durable cloths."
 wood_2:0 "Iron Axes"
 wood_2_desc:0 "Iron axes are significantly more resistent and keep a sharp edge for far longer than their bronze predecessors. This frees up a lot of time that used to be wasted sharpening the edge of the axes, and turns it into productive logging."
 stone_2:0 "Metal Drills"
 stone_2_desc:0 "Improvements in metalworking lead to the widespread use of metal tools. Cheif among them are metal drills, which are used to bore holes in cliff faces, which can then be wedged open to split the rock away from its source."
 storage_2:0 "Record Keeping"
 storage_2_desc:0 "As granaries fill up, it is important to keep track of which farmer owns how much of the stored grain. The developement of rudimentary writing systems means that less grain is wasted in disagreements between bickering farmers."
 farming_2:0 "Diversification"
 farming_2_desc:0 "It seems that different crops grow well in different seasons. By cultivating a wide selection of those crops, villages can be assured a certain amount of food in any season."
 food_2:0 "Selective Breeding
 food_2_desc:0 "Those stands of crops that were so bountiful in previous years have now been bread with one another, producing somehow even more productive variaties. Truly there is something to be learned here."
 tanning_2:0 "Domestication"
 tanning_2_desc:0 "Some species of animal that had been attracted to the scraps produced by farming have proven susceptible to taming and some have even integrated into society directly as pets, aiding further in the hunting of those animals that refused to bend to humanity's will."
 mining_2:0 "Pit Mining"
 mining_2_desc:0 "As above ground patches of metals dry up, the metal tools that they produced are used in turn to undermine them and search out even richer veins, carving huge open pits where low lying hills once stood."
 mining_c2:0 "Subbituminous"
 mining_c2_desc:0 "Mines get deeper and deeper now that they are well supported. It seems that not only are richer veins of metal found at this depth, but also of coal. The coal found in these deeper mines burns hotter and longer than the higher deposits."
 textile_2:0 "Cottage Industry"
 textile_2_desc:0 "As fewer and fewer people need to farm in order to feed a village, the specialty industry of weaving emerges, making cloth more common and therefore more accessible."
 wood_3:0 "Saws"
 wood_3_desc:0 "With the help of these tools, we can cut wood into planks of any shape or size, timber can now be used more efficiently than ever, with minimal waste."
 stone_3:0 "Hand Hewn Stone"
 stone_3_desc:0 "Some softer stones, like limestone and sandstone, can be cut by hand, a much faster and labor intensive process than spliting rock off from cliff faces using wedges."
 storage_3:0 "Salting and Smoking"
 storage_3_desc:0 "As mines move deeper and deeper into the earth, large deposits of salt are found that dwarf the above ground salt licks. Abundant salt makes the preservation of meat for winter easier and food more abundant even in the colder months."
 farming_3:0 "Irrigation"
 farming_3_desc:0 "Benders channel rivers, lakes, and streams, so that farmers no longer have to rely on the often unpredictable and sometimes deadly flooding to water their crops, so harvests are more frequent and less costly."
 food_3:0 "Crop Specialization"
 food_3_desc:0 "Until now, farmers settled on hills and those settled in rich river valleys have been cultivating the same crops to feed their local villages, but trade allows them to specialize in crops better suited to individual climes, which can then be traded for other necessities."
 tanning_3:0 "Animals Hunting Animals"
 tanning_3_desc:0 "Having mastered the taming of beasts of burden and game, hunters move on to taming a new class of animals: pets. By taming predators, hunters are able to use their newfound friends to track other wild game they have not yet tamed, increasing the variety of pelts available."
 mining_3:0 "Tunneling"
 mining_3_desc:0 "The surface deposits exausted, and pit mining proving increasingly inefficient, the only way to go is down. Larger logs felled by iron weapons prove up to the task of supporting the weight of the large underground mazes that begin to form."
 mining_c3:0 "Bituminous"
 mining_c3_desc:0 "Even deeper mines mean even better quality coal. Coal at this level burns brighter and longer than any encountered before, but is almost as abundant as the lower quality coal closer to the surface."
 textile_3:0 "Cotton Boom"
 textile_3_desc:0 "Irrigation and crop specialization have lead to an explosion in the production of textile crops, including flax and hemp, but most notably cotton, which can be grown practically anywhere and makes the finest cloth of the three."
 wood_4:0 "Timber Stands"
 wood_4_desc:0 "With most of the naturally occuring forests close to existing cities cut down, loggers have begun planting their own artificial forrests, choosing only the fastest growing and strongest trees, greatly speeding up timber production."
 stone_4:0 "River Barges"
 stone_4_desc:0 "Stone, unlike most other goods, is difficult to transport over land, but recent advancements in river transport mean that quarries can now be further away, increasing vareity and abundance of stone."
 storage_4:0 "Fermentation"
 storage_4_desc:0 "As storehouses fill up, some batches of crops are forgotten and left to rot. Later, when some are discovered they have been transformed into a much longer lasting, slightly intoxicating substance that quickly becomes popular."
 farming_4:0 "Fertilization"
 farming_4_desc:0 "Farmers who both grow crops and raise animals find that fields closest to their animal pens produce the most abundant crops. The link between manure and crop growth is quickly made and sewing fields with manure becomes a widespread practice."
 food_4:0 "Agricultural Exchange"
 food_4_desc: "Trade among villages leads to further diversification of crops some of which seem even better suited to grow in their new homes than in their original habitats. Some crops even grow well together, boosting each other's productivity."
 tanning_4:0 "Fur Trade"
 tanning_4_desc:0 "Foreign traders begin bringing new samples of exotic furs and pelts from unknown animals in far away lands. Wealthier towns and even nacient cities can afford to send expiditions to discover the source of these new pelts and fetch back more."
 mining_4:0 "Water Mills"
 mining_4_desc:0 "Water mills made of the newly abundant timber are able to crush rocks containing metal ores. Metals need only be present in very small concentrations to be effectively processed, so even mines that were once thought tapped out can be reopened."
 mining_c4:0 "Anthracite"
 mining_c4_desc:0 "The highest quality coal, anthracite deposits were thought rare until an increasing abundance of metal tools made mining tunnels deeper and wider, leading to vast underground networks spirling out in search of this hotest burning coal."
 textile_4:0 "The Flying Shuttle"
 textile_4_desc:0 "Even the least skilled weavers can now compose massive bolts of cloth in just a few days, revolutionizing the clothing industry and vastly increasing the number of people participating in the industry."
 wood_5:0 "The Lumber Mill"
 wood_5_desc:0 "A much larger version of the water mills used to crush ores and grains, water is used here to turn saw blades that turn logs into wooden planks in minutes, reducing the number of carpenters needed to process a tree significantly."
 stone_5:0 "Reinforced Wheeled Carts"
 stone_5_desc:0 "Wheeled carts used to transport grain and water were not quite up to the task of carrying stone until metal banding reinforcing the wheels and the undercairage let carts transport stone miles inland from the barges."
 storage_5:0 "Pickling"
 storage_5_desc:0 "The new fermented substances have proven doubly useful. When they are used to store food, both they and the food last longer, even if the food then takes on an odd tangy taste."
 farming_5:0 "Metal Plows"
 farming_5_desc:0 "One of the newly cheap metal tools is the plowshear. Up until now, plows have either been made of stone or wood and were useful, at most, for one season. New metal plows are both faster and longer lasting, freeing up farmers to til even more fields."
 food_5:0 "Selective Breeding"
 food_5_desc:0 "Farmers have been replanting the heartiest crop varieties for generations, but a recent discovery about the way that plants reproduce now allows them to breed plants with complementary attributes, creating entire new hybrid species."
 tanning_5:0 "Enclosure"
 tanning_5_desc:0 "The rapid expansion of animal raising in the new flourishing fur encomy has caused many disputes between ranchers about where farm animals will be allowed to graze. The enclosure of certain stretches of land with fences settles these disputes and stabilizes the animal market."
 mining_5:0 "Metal Bending"
 mining_5_desc:0 "The ingeneous discovery by a master earthbender that even refined metals stil contain traces of earth allows skilled earth benders to ferret out and extract metal at great distances without the trouble of digging great mines."
 mining_c5:0 "Mechanized Mining"
 mining_c5_desc:0 "New machines, some of them powered by the very coal that they mine, can carve out even the most hardened rock, allowing mining corporations to return to old mines long thought tapped out and remove any remaing traces of valuable coal."
 textile_5:0 "Spinning Jenny"
 textile_5_desc:0 "A significant improvement on the traditional spinning wheel, the spinning jenny increases the productivity of each worker nearly 10 fold. Spinning can now keep pace with the increased speed of weaving and even outpaces it in some places."
 stone_6:0 "Metal Wire"
 stone_6_desc:0 "Cooled with water and spun specifically for this purpose, metal wire, initially strung between two pieces of wood but eventually run through a steam turbine, can cut through even marble in seconds."
 storage_6:0 "Canning"
 storage_6_desc:0 "Blown glass jars with metal tops and honey or wax seals are capable of keeping food fresh for years, if not decades. When mixed with pickling, this process has even been known to keep food edible for generations."
 farming_6:0 "Mechanized Harvesting" 
 farming_6_desc:0 "Harvesters, hand powered seed drills, and even coal powered tractors all cut the need for manual labor to til fields and speed up harvests, allowing some farmers to grow two rounds of crops per season."
 food_6: "Crop Rotation"
 food_6_desc:0 "Even the most successful farmers have to leave some of their fields fallow once every several seasons, but that is costly, especially if the off season falls in a good year. By rotating in nitrogen fixing crops in, farmers can use every field in every season, doubling productivity."
 tanning_6:0 "Artificial Breeding"
 tanning_6_desc:0 "While it may seem a simple fact that animal husbandry depends directly on the natural reproductive cycle of the animals being raised, farmers discover that with special attention, animals can be artificially bred at a much faster rate, so there is little fear of depleting species entirely."
 mining_6:0 "Strip Mining"
 mining_6_desc:0 "New mechanical diggers powered by steam engine are able to remove tons of dirt and rock a minute. To some this sounds like a return to pit mining, but those that witness it up close equate it more to moving entire mountians. While once only benders could acomplish such feats, now any man with the right machine is capable."
 mining_c6:0 "Rail Construction"
 mining_c6_desc:0 "Coal mining companies have both abuntant access to coal and a need to transport it. Steam engines fitted to rail carts are able to pull cars a much greater distances than pack animals, opening the world up to coal fired machines."
 textile_6:0 "Industrial Weaving"
 textile_6_desc:0 "The mass production of weaving and spinning tools allows some wealthy business owners to accumulate massive troves of machines and then employ workers, many of them the former owners of smaller textile businesses, to produce unprecedented amounts of cloth.
 smelting_1:0 "Steelworks"
 smelting_1_desc:0 "Hot burning coal and finely ground ores combine much more easily than did charcoal and raw iron in olden times. Steel can now be mass produced in massive furnaces capable of melting hundreds of tones of ore at a time and molding it into ingots for distribution."
 smelting_2:0 "Cold Rolled Steel"
 smelting_2_desc:0 "The industrial process of producing steel by cooling it instantaneously rather than by working the metal until it cools. The resultant steel is far stronger and requires far less manpower and material."
 smelting_3:0 "Open-Hearth Steelmaking"
 smelting_3_desc:0 "By leaving one side of the molten steel open to the air, benders can ad different ingredients as needed. Now steel can be produced with lower grade materials mixed with balancing adatives, making it both cheaper and less wasteful."
 smelting_l1:0 "Standardized Machinery"
 smelting_l1_desc:0 "With all smelting machines standardized across all manufacturies, very little training is required before a laborer can produce reasonable quality steal quickly, greatly expanding the workforce and increasing production while minimizing waste."
 smelting_r1:0 "Vertical Integration"
 smelting_r1_desc:0 "Rather than focus on increasing the efficiency of production methods, some smelters choose instead to buy up mines and mills to ensure a steady, cheap supply of iron and coal, making high quality steel incredibly cheap."
 smelting_l2:0 "Pig Deer Iron"
 smelting_l2_desc:0 "A cheaper, higher carbon content variant of iron, it was once thought useless for its brital nature, but when melted to the appropriate temperature it can be mixed to produce cheap, high quality steel."
 smelting_r2:0 "National Contracts"
 smelting_r2_desc:0 "With so few businesses competing for weapons manufacturing contracts, steal companies are able to negotiate very favorable prices for their wares. They reinvest this money in even more productive capacity and steel flows as freely as water." 
 
 infrastructure_1:0 "Dirt Roads"
 infrastructure_1_desc:0 "Roads of packed earth criss cross the countryside, many made by earth benders, but others simply tamped down by hand. The new networks they form facilitate new levels of efficiency."
 granary_1:0 "Granaries"
 granary_1_desc:0 "Harvests are becoming more and more abundant as society gets used to farming rather than foraging. Anything gathered must be stored in a safe, dry place if it is going to last long enough to keep people fed through the winter."
 infrastructure_2:0 "Canals"
 infrastructure_2_desc:0 "Ditches dug along roads begin to grow into channels, then creeks, then small streams. Soon they are navigable and new ones are being dug specifically to connect major waterways."
 port_1:0 "Stone Breakwaters"
 port_1_desc:0 "Long stone arms sweep out into bays and natural harbors to prevent erosion and reduce the danger from large waves generated by storms. Ports can now safely accomodate more ships and require less maintenance, incentivizing more complex construction."
 port_2:0 "Retaining Walls"
 port_2_desc:0 "Stone walls hold land back from the sea, allowing for the deepening of ports. Ships can now come right up to the edge of the land to offload, making ports more efficient."
 port_3:0 "Piled Jetties"
 port_3_desc:0 "Rather than having to bring ships all the way into the shore or having to sink tons of stone to extend the shore to the ships, wooden pylons can now be driven into the soft sea bed to support long piers, made possible by advanced milling to make standard supports."
 port_4:0 "Roll On Roll Off"
 port_4_desc:0 "The advent of rolling vehicles and hinged ship hulls allows carts carrying goods long distance to roll straight from the road, across the docks, and straight onto the boats, increasing loading speed and decreasing labor costs for loading and unloading."
 port_5:0 "Bulk Terminals"
 port_5_desc:0 "Certain ports are closer to sources of extraction for particular raw materials and manufactured goods. They begin to specialize in shipping that one particular good, setting up infrastructure for loading and offloading and routing pipelines and other key infrastructure directly into the port."
 fort_1:0 "Rammed Earth"
 fort_1_desc:0 "Packed earth is easy to assemble and easier to maintain, but surprisingly effective at keeping out enemies. The only downside is that their long slopes can easily be climed if defenders are not watching."
 fort_2:0 "Stone Walls"
 fort_2_desc:0 "Early fortifications are either of bent or stacked stone held together by either shear gravtiational force or grooves cut into the stone. While the fortifications in the earth kingdoms are smoother and more uniform, all masons are able to achieve massive defensive walls."
 fort_3:0 "Earthen Ditches and Ramparts"
 fort_3_desc:0 "The advancement of bending techniques and the invention of explosives makes stone walls irrelevant, so cities start stacking earth up against their walls to muffle the explosions and digging ditches, sometimes repurposing old moats, to collect shrapnel."
 fort_4:0 "Star Forts"
 fort_4_desc:0 "Newly constructed and rebuilt forts are built with angled walls that allow for greater fields of vision while reducing the impact of explosives. These walls are both sturdier and require less repair."
 fort_5:0 "Polygonal Forts"
 fort_5_desc:0 "Rather than a single star fort, a series of smaller, lower profile forts ringing important sites now provide harder targets for explosives. Deep trench-like ditches fortified with stone ring these installations, providing cover for troops tasked with defending them."
 costal_fort_1:0 "Early Warning System"
 costal_fort_1_desc:0 "Most naval invasions in this day and age come in the form of up river raiding parties. The best way to fortify against those raids is to set up a series of lookout posts that allow cities up river to prepare for defense before the raiders arrive."
 costal_fort_2:0 "River Mouth Fortifications"
 costal_fort_2_desc:0 "To prevent raiding parties even getting up stream, forts are build at the mouths of navigable rivers. Some of these forts were equiped with chains or nets that can close off the river mouth and all are armed with benders prepared to sink approaching ships."
 costal_fort_3:0 "Sea Forts"
 costal_fort_3_desc:0 "Permenant emplacements situated either on coastal ridges or on islands near by potential landing sites keep close watch on the sea to prevent invading forces landing on unguarded beaches, many of which are no where near cities that could warn forces of approaching invaders."
 costal_fort_4:0 "Camouflaged Defenses"
 costal_fort_4_desc:0 "Defenses shrouded in plants and burried in hills retake the element of surprise from the enemy, making no landing site a safe bet, and making it much harder for supporting ships to take out defenses as forces land."
 infrastructure_3:0 "Paving"
 infrastructure_3_desc:0 "Canals are by far a faster method of travel than overland routes, but are limited to areas between major bodies of water. Roads paved with gravel or concrete are almost as fast to travel along as waterways and allow vast inland areas access to economic prosperity"
 settlement_1:0 "Trade Outpost Towns"
 settlement_1_desc:0 "Trade outposts, originally built as small villages just to hunt and trap animals for fur, develop into trading towns as roads reach out and connect them to wider markets and make travel to them safer and easier."
 settlement_2:0 "Homesteading"
 settlement_2_desc:0 "Governments, keen on developing their agricultural regions, begin incentivizing moving out to more rural areas. Small towns spring up along canals and roads near these new homesteads, and some quickly grow into small cities."
 settlement_3:0 "Fugitive Poor"
 settlement_3_desc:0 "Poor serfs, peasants, and even some city dwellers down on their luck begin fleeing to the frontier in search of better opportunity outside of social class and soceoeconomic stricture."
 settlement_4:0 "Official Incorporation"
 settlement_4_desc:0 "The far flung townships have become regional centers of power and population. Some of them are even begining to rival the larger capitol cities on the coast. By officially incorporating them into the kingdoms by installing local governments, they gain access to even more resources and expand even faster."
 infrastructure_4:0 "Railways"
 infrastructure_4_desc:0 "Following either rivers or existing roads in most places, railroads, powered either by coal or by bending, are able to carry freight and people far further and far faster than carts pulled over land or boats in canals."
 infrastructure_5:0 "Tarmac"
 infrastructure_5_desc:0 "Increasing efficiencies in mining allow for the use of extra mining products in paving roads. These products, when mixed with the usual sand and gravel used to pave roads, create a hard, black surface that is both easy to apply and breaks down far more slowly."
 farm_and_lumber:0 "Milling"
 farm_and_lumber_desc:0 "Water wheels power an entirely new generation of industry in both farming and woodcutting. Farmers are able to take their grain to the mill for processing and woodcutters are able to get their wood processed much faster than planing it by hand."
 farm_1:0 "Subsistance Farming"
 farm_1_desc:0 "Most farmers are producing just enough crops to feed their families, and their immediate villages. What farmers are prosperous enough to sell their crops mainly sell them to neighboring villages who have fallen on hard times."
 farm_2:0 "Farming for Export"
 farm_2_desc:0 "Innovations in fertilizer and farm implements allow even the most basic farmers to begin specializing and exporting farm products to neighboring kingdoms. The extra profit translates into even more land and even better tools, leading to even bigger harvests."
 weaving_1:0 "Textile Crops"
 weaving_1_desc:0 "As farmers begin to specialize and increase efficiency, food is abundant and some farmers switch to utility crops rather than foodstuffs. Cotton, flax, and silk become abundant and textile manufacturing comes into its own."
 weaving_2:0 "Wool"
 weaving_2_desc:0 "In civilizations poorly equiped to grow textile crops, the cloth making industry grows slower, but once large scale animal husbandry takes off, it quickly catches up and even replaces cotton in certain regions. Wool is a more durable fiber and less prone to rotting, so it trades much longer range."
 weaving_3:0 "Stylized Cloth"
 weaving_3_desc:0 "Some towns are working with better material than others and become widely known for their high quality craftsmanship. Their techniques are closely guarded and slow to spread, but they do revolutionize the production of cloth."
 farm_3:0 "Manorial System"
 farm_3_desc:0 "Landowners, enriched by either luck or early innovation, begin buying up larger and larger plots of land. Soon they begin hiring hands to work that land. Consolidated farms are more efficient than smaller family operations."
 farm_4:0 "International Cooperation"
 farm_4_desc:0 "Each nation has a unique climate and soil type that makes it better at farming particular crops. By forming large international cooperatives, farmers can ensure that their quotas are met, even if they specialize only in one or two crops, through massive international trade agreements."
 lumber_1:0 "Industrial Rafts"
 lumber_1_desc:0 "With mills making timber processing ever more efficient, more wood is needed and forests are quickly cleared. Companies must go farther afield to find fresh sources and begin using rivers to transport logs down stream in large industrial rafts."
 quarry_1:0 "Sandstone"
 quarry_1_desc:0 "Sandstone is a softer stone and the easiest to quarry with simple tools. Entire mountainsides are carved out using simple hand tools and wooden scaffolding. It does not take very long until entire industries rise up to exploit sandstone mining for monumental builidng projects."
 quarry_2:0 "Marble"
 quarry_2_desc:0 "Marble is a much rarer, but much more sought after building material. It is sturdier than sandstone and weathers much more slowly. However, it is not until the advent of metal tools that large scale extraction of marble is made possible. The subsequent boom is practically unstoppable."
 quarry_3:0 "Granite"
 quarry_3_desc:0 "Granite is even stronger than marble and much more abundant, while it is not as admired by architects, it gains a certain humble following among the common people and its use soars once extraction on an industrial scale is made possible by the steam engine."
 lumber_2:0 "Wood Steaming"
 lumber_2_desc:0 "Wood that is steamed is both fire resistand and mold resistant. This process is fairly simple and straightforward, so it becomes commonplace fairly quickly and most industrial timber is steemed at a certain point. Buildings made of steamed timber last longer and are less likely to colapse."
 lumber_3:0 "Trade Companies"
 lumber_3_desc:0 "Timber is in high demand and forests cannot regrow fast enough to keep pace. Companies are formed to explore forgotten or far flung territories to discover new sources, opening up the industry to even more varieties of source material."
 mine_1:0 "Repurposed Quarries"
 mine_1_desc:0 "While quarrying rock, some companies come across veins of precious metals and rare gems. Once it is clear that these companies can make more money mining these new discoveries than the rocks they came for, a new source of mined minerals comes into being."
 mine_2:0 "Waste Water"
 mine_2_desc:0 "Aquaducts and nearby rivers are used to cart away useless rubble, a frequent byproduct of these new mines. Not having to store these rocks on site frees up space and the downriver side effects are outweighed by the speed boost this gives to mining output."
 mine_3:0 "Consolidated Corporations"
 mine_3_desc:0 "The same companies that are mining rock are now also mining precious minerals. Using their equipment to identify new sources of both, new mines crop up all over the four nations and production explodes overnight."
 steelworks_1:0 "Smelting"
 steelworks_1_desc:0 "Mining companies encounter more and more veins of iron in their rapid exploration for precious metals. Eventually it becomes clear that they can use similar techniques to those they use to refine ores to strengthen iron on an industrial scale into steel. New shops crop up in and around mining towns to produce this high end steel."
 watchtower_1:0 "Flying Machines"
 watchtower_1_desc:0 "There are whispers that the other nations are developing flying machines that can circumvent conventional defenses. We may be years away from our own flying machines, but we need to prepare now. A series of watchtowers tall enough to spot them far away should shore up our defenses in the mean time."
 air_base_1:0 "Grassy Fields"
 air_base_1_desc:0 "Now that we are prepared to use our own air force, we need places to house and deploy our new weapons. Some farmers have graciously sold us their fields, which are wide and flat enough to take off and land from and will do while they are under construction."
 air_base_2:0 "Dirt Tracks"
 air_base_2_desc:0 "Once the fields are cleared of crops, tree stumps, and rocks, they are much safer to land on and take off from. Meanwhile, small wooden and stone buidlings are thrown up to shelter the equipment until more permenant structures can be built."
 air_base_3:0 "Concrete Ports"
 air_base_3_desc:0 "Old farms turn to dirt paths and then to concrete pads that provide both a solid landing surface and a much safer impact, so equipment is damaged less often. Concrete buildings also create more permenant housing for aircraft, so wear and tear overtime is diminished and more can be stored at once."
 air_base_4:0 "Professional Staff"
 air_base_4_desc:0 "Until now, military staff more used to naval maneuvers and troop movements, have been running the rudimentary airports, leading to mistakes. Now that air warfare is hear to stay, the military has created a seperate branch of trained staff to manage them, leading to increased efficiencies."
 air_base_5:0 "Standardized Layouts"
 air_base_5_desc:0 "Some airports operate smoother than others and military planners take notice. Smaller details are incorporated quickly, like taller observation towers and larger hangars. Some older facilities are entirely rebuilt to include wider fields and state of the art mechanics."
 anti_air_1:0 "Designated Archers"
 anti_air_1_desc:0 "Our watchtowers are reporting more and more aircraft making their way into our territory. Gone are the days when a few benders could be despatched to take down a loan incursion. Now entire teams of archers are devoted to watching the skies for aircraft and trained to shoot them down."
 anti_air_2:0 "Specialty Arrows"
 anti_air_2_desc:0 "Archers are complaining that it takes several volleys of arrows to down a single aircraft. They warn that if more aircraft appear they may not be able to take them all down before the damage is done. Special metal arrows are developed to penetrate the newly hardened, faster aircraft and ensure security."
 anti_air_3:0 "Benders Depolyed"
 anti_air_3_desc:0 "Benders have typically been reserved for man to man military engagements, but the air has become its own battlefield. New teams of benders have been deployed alongside the more experienced archers. Soon they are developing their own tactics."
 anti_air_4:0 "Armored Installments"
 anti_air_4_desc:0 "Even benders are not safe from the progress of airborne warfare and to keep them safe new defenses while they fight back, new defenses are needed. Bunkers made of stone or metal are erected around major cities and wheeled around with armies to protect them from aerial attack."
 anti_air_5:0 "Decoys and Traps"
 anti_air_5_desc:0 "It took longer than expected, but aerial warfare has now caught up with its conventional cousin. Military tacticians have begun releasing fake military plans, building fake towers, and even assembling fake armies to get the drop on the ever expanding air forces."
