 THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_NAME:0 "The War beginns"
 THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "With the arriving comet, Firelord Sozin plans to conquer the whole world and share the Firenations fortune with it. Only the Avatar could stop him now. Will the Fire Nation win?"
 EAR_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The mighty Earth Kingdom, the largest and most populated realm the World has ever seen, its people are diverse, strong and steadfast... A curse disguised as blessing. For hundreds of years the kingdom has been plagued by petty rivalry, unrest and conflict... Meanwhile its Kings hide safely behind the many walls of Ba Sing Se where they are fed lies by their increasingly ambitious and shrewd advisors. As the kingdom slowly slips from royal grasp, Jackals from the West have already encroached on our shores, unopposed, and the King's inaction required the Avatar's action to drive the Fire Nation away. But now the Avatar is but a child..."
 SWT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The South Pole is a harsh and unforgiving place... and yet, the people of the South have lived and thrived here for hundreds of generations. There is no hardship that the Watertribesmen cannot adapt and overcome. Dark clouds gather, the world is getting more dangerous by the day, the oceans are restless and the moon shines an ominous light, the elders talk of a great evil about to come... But regardless of what lies ahead, our people will resist, adapt, and overcome. A thousand years from now the Southern Water tribes will still sing under the same moon, and dance under the same ice. "
 NWT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Merchants from the south come bringing whispers and speculation of a great war to come, the meek and the alarmist make great tides out of a pond, but our people and our proud traditions are safe, protected by trecherous waters of the Arctic and the mighty ice walls of our glaciers. No enemy is foolish enough to set foot on Northern land, and should any force, drunk on power and madness dare to set foot on our ancestral home, then it will deal with the immense fury of our brave warriors, who will go the greatest sacrifices necessary and them some more, in order to protect their kin and culture."
 FIR_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Long past are the days of isolated, backwards and powerhungry warring clans struggling for power in the Fire Islands. Ever since united under the iron fist of the Royal Family, the Fire Nation has began experiencing an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity... But the fire of ambition still burns deep inside every firebender in these islands, and now Firelord Sozin looks East, the time has come for the Fire Nation to assume its dominant role in the world and lead its uncivilised peoples to enlightenment, by force if necessary. The time of flame and blade is nigh!"
 SAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Amidst the foggy cliffs of the Patola mountains, the new Avatar has been reborn, and thus the Southern Air temple will play the decisive role in the troubling times to come, on their hands is the task raising, trainning and preparing the young Avatar to return peace and balance to such an increasingly volatile and dangerous world."
 WAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The Western Air temple has always been the least isolated and most vulnerable of the air temples, being populated entierly by women and standing at the crossroads between the influence of the Fire Nation, Earth Kingdom and Northern Water Tribes. Thus, these temples were built strategically upside-down under a cragg between the mountains, out of sight and out of reach from any outside threat. But of course, no hideout is perfect, and no fortress is impregnable."
 EAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The Eastern Air temple has been the home of the last Airbender Avatar, Yangchen, and thus her doctrine is still very much present among the women of this temple. Yangchen's teachings were quite unorthodox for a typical pacifist airbender way, and didn't shy away from the use of stern, decisive action and even violence if strictly necessary to achieve the greater good."
 NAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The Northern Air temple, inhabited exclusively by men, stands imposingly amidst the largest and highest mountain range of the world, its close proximity to the north pole makes this temple a haven of life amidst a dangerous and inhospitable land. Despite directly bordering the great Earth Kingdom this temple has always retained independence and avoided conflict due to the natural buffer zone provided by the Laghima Range."
 KYI_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Once a peninsula and part of the Earth Kingdom, this Island was violently ripped appart from the rest of the Continent by Avatar Kioshy herself, who had been born in here, in order to secure the peninsula's indepence from the Tyrant Chin "the Usurper". And thus the now Island has enjoyed a period of isolation and near complete autonomy from the Earth Crown. After the death of Kyoshi, this Island has developed its unique martial art and culture based on the teachings of the Avatar, and now the famed Kyoshi warriors continue the Avatar's legacy of protecting this Island".

 WAR_WATER_NAME:0 "Attack on the Poles"
 WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "It´s been 25 years since the Fire Nation's devastating defeat at the north pole. There are rumors that they gather their fleet to start a second invasion. However the target remains unknown."

 GENERAL_IROH_NAME:0 "The Siege of Ba Sing Se"
 GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "After 94 years, not only the Firenation is exhausted from the war, but so is every other nation too. However, the war not only brought death and perdition. Through various fought battles, newer and deadlier war machines have been invented. Each side will need a decisive blow ... soon!"

 THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_NAME:0 "The Boy in the Iceberg"
 THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang."
 EAR_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "The Fire Nation is taking over."
 SWT_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Still Watertribe."
