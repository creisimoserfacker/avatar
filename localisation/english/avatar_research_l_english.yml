 construction_l3:0 "Cut Stone"
 construction_l3_desc:0 "Hardened stone tools allow masons to start carving stone building blocks directly out of cliffsides and mointains. While these stones do not fully replace mud bricks as the most common buidling material, they do make certain key buidlings significantly more stable."
 construction_r3:0 "Metal Drills"
 construction_r3_desc:0 "Using rudimentary bronze drills, masons can now detatch larger blocks of stone by drilling holes that are then expanded into cracks using wooden wedges. Fewer of these larger blocks are needed to finish buildings."

 storage_3:0 "Salting and Smoking"
 storage_3_desc:0 "As mines move deeper and deeper into the earth, large deposits of salt are found that dwarf the above ground salt licks. Abundant salt makes the preservation of meat for winter easier and food more abundant even in the colder months."
 farming_3:0 "Irrigation"
 farming_3_desc:0 "Benders channel rivers, lakes, and streams, so that farmers no longer have to rely on the often unpredictable and sometimes deadly flooding to water their crops, so harvests are more frequent and less costly."
 food_3:0 "Crop Specialization"
 food_3_desc:0 "Until now, farmers settled on hills and those settled in rich river valleys have been cultivating the same crops to feed their local villages, but trade allows them to specialize in crops better suited to individual climes, which can then be traded for other necessities."
 tanning_3:0 "Animals Hunting Animals"
 tanning_3_desc:0 "Having mastered the taming of beasts of burden and game, hunters move on to taming a new class of animals: pets. By taming predators, hunters are able to use their newfound friends to track other wild game they have not yet tamed, increasing the variety of pelts available."
 mining_3:0 "Tunneling"

 mining_c3:0 "Bituminous"
 mining_c3_desc:0 "Even deeper mines mean even better quality coal. Coal at this level burns brighter and longer than any encountered before, but is almost as abundant as the lower quality coal closer to the surface."
 textile_3:0 "Cotton Boom"
 textile_3_desc:0 "Irrigation and crop specialization have lead to an explosion in the production of textile crops, including flax and hemp, but most notably cotton, which can be grown practically anywhere and makes the finest cloth of the three."
 wood_4:0 "Timber Stands"
 wood_4_desc:0 "With most of the naturally occuring forests close to existing cities cut down, loggers have begun planting their own artificial forrests, choosing only the fastest growing and strongest trees, greatly speeding up timber production."
 stone_4:0 "River Barges"
 stone_4_desc:0 "Stone, unlike most other goods, is difficult to transport over land, but recent advancements in river transport mean that quarries can now be further away, increasing vareity and abundance of stone."
 storage_4:0 "Fermentation"
 storage_4_desc:0 "As storehouses fill up, some batches of crops are forgotten and left to rot. Later, when some are discovered they have been transformed into a much longer lasting, slightly intoxicating substance that quickly becomes popular."
 farming_4:0 "Fertilization"
 farming_4_desc:0 "Farmers who both grow crops and raise animals find that fields closest to their animal pens produce the most abundant crops. The link between manure and crop growth is quickly made and sewing fields with manure becomes a widespread practice."
 food_4:0 "Agricultural Exchange"
 food_4_desc: "Trade among villages leads to further diversification of crops some of which seem even better suited to grow in their new homes than in their original habitats. Some crops even grow well together, boosting each other's productivity."
 tanning_4:0 "Fur Trade"
 tanning_4_desc:0 "Foreign traders begin bringing new samples of exotic furs and pelts from unknown animals in far away lands. Wealthier towns and even nacient cities can afford to send expiditions to discover the source of these new pelts and fetch back more."
 mining_4:0 "Water Mills"
 mining_4_desc:0 "Water mills made of the newly abundant timber are able to crush rocks containing metal ores. Metals need only be present in very small concentrations to be effectively processed, so even mines that were once thought tapped out can be reopened."
 mining_c4:0 "Anthracite"
 mining_c4_desc:0 "The highest quality coal, anthracite deposits were thought rare until an increasing abundance of metal tools made mining tunnels deeper and wider, leading to vast underground networks spirling out in search of this hotest burning coal."
 textile_4:0 "The Flying Shuttle"
 textile_4_desc:0 "Even the least skilled weavers can now compose massive bolts of cloth in just a few days, revolutionizing the clothing industry and vastly increasing the number of people participating in the industry."
 wood_5:0 "The Lumber Mill"
 wood_5_desc:0 "A much larger version of the water mills used to crush ores and grains, water is used here to turn saw blades that turn logs into wooden planks in minutes, reducing the number of carpenters needed to process a tree significantly."
 stone_5:0 "Reinforced Wheeled Carts"
 stone_5_desc:0 "Wheeled carts used to transport grain and water were not quite up to the task of carrying stone until metal banding reinforcing the wheels and the undercairage let carts transport stone miles inland from the barges."
 storage_5:0 "Pickling"
 storage_5_desc:0 "The new fermented substances have proven doubly useful. When they are used to store food, both they and the food last longer, even if the food then takes on an odd tangy taste."
 farming_5:0 "Metal Plows"
 farming_5_desc:0 "One of the newly cheap metal tools is the plowshear. Up until now, plows have either been made of stone or wood and were useful, at most, for one season. New metal plows are both faster and longer lasting, freeing up farmers to til even more fields."
 food_5:0 "Selective Breeding"
 food_5_desc:0 "Farmers have been replanting the heartiest crop varieties for generations, but a recent discovery about the way that plants reproduce now allows them to breed plants with complementary attributes, creating entire new hybrid species."
 tanning_5:0 "Enclosure"
 tanning_5_desc:0 "The rapid expansion of animal raising in the new flourishing fur encomy has caused many disputes between ranchers about where farm animals will be allowed to graze. The enclosure of certain stretches of land with fences settles these disputes and stabilizes the animal market."
 mining_5:0 "Drilling and Blasting"
 mining_5_desc:0 "Some areas are simply not economically viable to dig into with tools alone. With the use of controlled explosions, long tunnels can be carved out of hard rock to reach resource-rich areas."
 mining_c5:0 "Mechanized Mining"
 mining_c5_desc:0 "New machines, some of them powered by the very coal that they mine, can carve out even the most hardened rock, allowing mining corporations to return to old mines long thought tapped out and remove any remaing traces of valuable coal."
 textile_5:0 "Spinning Jenny"
 textile_5_desc:0 "A significant improvement on the traditional spinning wheel, the spinning jenny increases the productivity of each worker nearly 10 fold. Spinning can now keep pace with the increased speed of weaving and even outpaces it in some places."
 stone_6:0 "Metal Wire"
 stone_6_desc:0 "Cooled with water and spun specifically for this purpose, metal wire, initially strung between two pieces of wood but eventually run through a steam turbine, can cut through even marble in seconds."
 storage_6:0 "Jellying"
 storage_6_desc:0 "By cooking food within materials that solidify into a gel, it can not only be preserved, but can also be eaten as is with little preparation."
 storage_7:0 "Canning"
 storage_7_desc:0 "Blown glass jars with metal tops and honey or wax seals are capable of keeping food fresh for years, if not decades. When mixed with pickling, this process has even been known to keep food edible for generations."
 storage_8:0 "Freeze Drying"
 storage_8_desc:0 "Food that is repeatedly exposed to freezing temperatures and drained of all water can reach a dried state, and once canned, can last several decades."
 farming_6:0 "Mechanized Harvesting" 
 farming_6_desc:0 "Harvesters, hand powered seed drills, and even coal powered tractors all cut the need for manual labor to til fields and speed up harvests, allowing some farmers to grow two rounds of crops per season."
 food_6:0 "Crop Rotation"
 food_6_desc:0 "Even the most successful farmers have to leave some of their fields fallow once every several seasons, but that is costly, especially if the off season falls in a good year. By rotating in nitrogen fixing crops in, farmers can use every field in every season, doubling productivity."
 tanning_6:0 "Artificial Breeding"
 tanning_6_desc:0 "While it may seem a simple fact that animal husbandry depends directly on the natural reproductive cycle of the animals being raised, farmers discover that with special attention, animals can be artificially bred at a much faster rate, so there is little fear of depleting species entirely."
 mining_6:0 "Strip Mining"
 mining_6_desc:0 "New mechanical diggers powered by steam engine are able to remove tons of dirt and rock a minute. To some this sounds like a return to pit mining, but those that witness it up close equate it more to moving entire mountians. While once only benders could acomplish such feats, now any man with the right machine is capable."
 mining_c6:0 "Rail Construction"
 mining_c6_desc:0 "Coal mining companies have both abundant access to coal and a need to transport it. Steam engines fitted to rail carts are able to pull cars a much greater distances than pack animals, opening the world up to coal fired machines."
 textile_6:0 "Industrial Weaving"
 textile_6_desc:0 "The mass production of weaving and spinning tools allows some wealthy business owners to accumulate massive troves of machines and then employ workers, many of them the former owners of smaller textile businesses, to produce unprecedented amounts of cloth."
 smelting_1:0 "Steelworks"
 smelting_1_desc:0 "Hot burning coal and finely ground ores combine much more easily than did charcoal and raw iron in olden times. Steel can now be mass produced in massive furnaces capable of melting hundreds of tones of ore at a time and molding it into ingots for distribution."
 smelting_2:0 "Cold Rolled Steel"
 smelting_2_desc:0 "The industrial process of producing steel by cooling it instantaneously rather than by working the metal until it cools. The resultant steel is far stronger and requires far less manpower and material."
 smelting_3:0 "Open-Hearth Steelmaking"
 smelting_3_desc:0 "By leaving one side of the molten steel open to the air, benders can ad different ingredients as needed. Now steel can be produced with lower grade materials mixed with balancing adatives, making it both cheaper and less wasteful."
 smelting_l1:0 "Standardized Machinery"
 smelting_l1_desc:0 "With all smelting machines standardized across all manufacturies, very little training is required before a laborer can produce reasonable quality steal quickly, greatly expanding the workforce and increasing production while minimizing waste."
 smelting_r1:0 "Vertical Integration"
 smelting_r1_desc:0 "Rather than focus on increasing the efficiency of production methods, some smelters choose instead to buy up mines and mills to ensure a steady, cheap supply of iron and coal, making high quality steel incredibly cheap."
 smelting_l2:0 "Pig Deer Iron"
 smelting_l2_desc:0 "A cheaper, higher carbon content variant of iron, it was once thought useless for its brital nature, but when melted to the appropriate temperature it can be mixed to produce cheap, high quality steel."
 smelting_r2:0 "National Contracts"
 smelting_r2_desc:0 "With so few businesses competing for weapons manufacturing contracts, steal companies are able to negotiate very favorable prices for their wares. They reinvest this money in even more productive capacity and steel flows as freely as water."

 port_3:0 "Piled Jetties"
 port_3_desc:0 "Rather than having to bring ships all the way into the shore or having to sink tons of stone to extend the shore to the ships, wooden pylons can now be driven into the soft sea bed to support long piers, made possible by advanced milling to make standard supports."
 port_4:0 "Roll On Roll Off"

 coastal_fort_1_desc:0 "Most naval invasions in this day and age come in the form of up river raiding parties. The best way to fortify against those raids is to set up a series of lookout posts that allow cities up river to prepare for defense before the raiders arrive."
 coastal_fort_2:0 "River Mouth Fortifications"
 coastal_fort_2_desc:0 "To prevent raiding parties even getting up stream, forts are build at the mouths of navigable rivers. Some of these forts were equiped with chains or nets that can close off the river mouth and all are armed with benders prepared to sink approaching ships."
 coastal_fort_3:0 "Sea Forts"
 coastal_fort_3_desc:0 "Permenant emplacements situated either on coastal ridges or on islands near by potential landing sites keep close watch on the sea to prevent invading forces landing on unguarded beaches, many of which are no where near cities that could warn forces of approaching invaders."
 coastal_fort_4:0 "Camouflaged Defenses"
