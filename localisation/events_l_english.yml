 news.3.d:0 "A wild population of bears has been discovered to roam the eastern coast of the earth kingdom, this species has been declared extinct 72 years ago with the exception being the earth king's beloved bosco. According to researchers the bear unlike its relatives, likes to collect and share metal objects (such as hammers and sickles) amongst it's bear and platypus bear comrades. Apparantly much like the earth king's Bosco, the bear is very loyal and appears to not be able to survive on its own as well as its closely related platypus bear does, researchers believe this to be the reason why they lived so closely to the platypus bear."
 #The researchers who allegedly found this population were researching the behaviour of a population of platypus bears, an evolutionary close relative to the bear, when they discovered bears to roam amongst them.

 #fall and retake news
 far_news.1.t:0 "The Fall of Taku"
 far_news.1.d:0 "The major trading hub of Taku has been taken by the Fire Nation. Reports have come in of citizens fleeing for their lives from Taku as the Fire Nation attacked, taking whatever they could with them. As the survivors fled into the mountains, they looked back and saw nothing but fire and ash. The town they had lived in for so long was now gone. The survivors now search for a safe place to spend the rest of their lives, or at least until this war ends. Some have mentioned going to Ba Sing Se where the walls will keep them safe, but the journey will be long and treachous even without the Fire Nation. One thing is for certain, with Taku gone the Earth Kingdom has lost one of their most vital financial hubs, and the Fire Nation has gained a powerful naval base."
 far_news.1.a:0 "A severe blow to the Earth Kingdom"
 far_news.1.b:0 "A decisive and resounding victory."
 far_news.1.c:0 "We will avenge Taku in time..."
 
 far_news.2.t:0 "The Fall of Yu Dao"
 far_news.2.d:0 "Reports are coming in of Fire Nation soldiers advancing into the state of Makapu and seizing the city of Yu Dao. While not the most important city in the western region of the Earth Kingdom, its loss will still be felt. Especially due to the loss of the states iron deposits. The iron will now be put to use conquering more Earth Kingdom states, instead of protecting those states from the Fire Nations war machine. Fire Nation Troops are expected to continue their conquest of the western region of the Earth Kingdom, but the Earth Kingdom army is doing all they can to stop them. The question remains, whether or not they will be able to stop the powerful advance of the Fire Nation. Perhaps the only thing that can stop them is the great wall of Ba Sing Se."
 far_news.2.a:0 "The Fire Nation is out of control!"
 far_news.2.b:0 "The invasion is proceeding as planned."
 far_news.2.c:0 "They will regret ever setting foot on our soil!"
 
 far_news.3.t:0 "The Fall of Garsai"
 far_news.3.d:0 "The great city of Garsai has fallen to the Fire Nation. After a bloody siege for the city, Fire Nation forces came out on top. It is unclear at this time what the fate of the city itself will be, but many of its residents were left running for the hills. The soldiers from the battle did not fair much better. Those who weren't killed were either captured or ran for their lives. The whereabouts of the leadership of Garsai are unknown at this time, which leaves some vital Earth Kingdom soldiers searching for them. This victory certainly shows the power of the Fire Nation, and questions the power of the Earth Kingdom. One thing is for certain, there is no way that the Fire Nation will ever be able to conquer the unconquerable city of Ba Sing Se."
 far_news.3.a:0 "The Fire Nation is making gains..."
 far_news.3.b:0 "A great victory for our Nation!"
 far_news.3.c:0 "A minor setback."
 
 far_news.4.t:0 "The Fall of Tienhai City"
 far_news.4.d:0 "Fire Nation troops captured the capital of Yue, Tienhai City, today. With Tienhai City gone the whole state of Yue will soon follow. This will create a central posistion to attack the rest of the western region from, and will be a vital base to the Fire Nation. Yue is also a resource rich state which will allow the Fire Nation to prolong this war against the Earth Kingdom. The war may soon swallow up the entire western region of the Earth Kingdom. As a result, reports are coming in of citizens from all over the western region fleeing either toward the southern region or toward Ba Sing Se. Despite the Fire Nation's victories, many believe that it is only a matter of time before the Earth Kingdom comes out on top."
 far_news.4.a:0 "Worrying..."
 far_news.4.b:0 "The Firelord will be proud."
 far_news.4.c:0 "We must recover the city within a fortnight"
 
 far_news.5.t:0 "The Fall of Han Tui"
 far_news.5.d:0 "The Fire Nation's army has conquered Han Tui after a lengthy siege. A drought in the area had caused ideal conditions for a fire. The Fire Nation general realised this and began burnining down the city's surrounding forest. Within hours the city itself was burning to the ground, and the already undersupplied troops holding it were forced to surrender. Some troops refused though, and stories from surviving citizens tell of a valiant defense to allow time for them to evacuate the city. Stories also tell of the wasteland that the Fire Nation has created by burning down the forest. Massive swaths of once thriving forest are now nothing but ash. Survivors hope to make it to Ba Sing Se, but some are uncertain if its walls of are truly impenetrable."
 far_news.5.a:0 "When will the violence end?"
 far_news.5.b:0 "A glorious victory!"
 far_news.5.c:0 "Light a candle for our fallen heros."
 
 far_news.6.t:0 "The Fall of Gaipan"
 far_news.6.d:0 "The small logging village of Gaipan has fallen to the Fire Nation. Gaipan was the largest Earth Kingdom settlement in the Great Divide, and helped the Earth Kingdom keep an eye on the Gaipan River which leads into the Western Lake. With control over Gaipan the Fire Nation is now one step closer to the great walls of Ba Sing Se. Luckily the great walls of Ba Sing Se will never fall to the Fire Nation. For the people of Gaipan however, Ba Sing Se is a long ways away. To get to the great city they will have to cross The Great Divide, which could be more treacherous than just submitting to the Fire Nation. Some have already given up and are willing to continue their logging underneath the Fire Nation's flag."
 far_news.6.a:0 "Is Ba Sing Se truly safe?"
 far_news.6.b:0 "The path to the Western Lake is clear."
 far_news.6.c:0 "The south must not fall!"
 
 far_news.7.t:0 "The Fall of Gaoling"
 far_news.7.d:0 "War has reached the southern reaches of the Earth Kingdom, the great city of Gaoling has been captured by Fire Nation armies. The Fire Nation managed to take the city after a bloody and prolonged siege. When the siege had finally ended survivors report that a third of the city had been burnt to the ground with nothing but ash and charcoal left. This third sadly includes the Beifong family's estate. The current location and status of the Beifong family is unknown at this time, but considering their power they are expected to have been able to escape. Other survivors of Gaoling are left wondering where to go for safety. Crossing the Si Wong desert to get to Ba Sing Se seems impossible, but many are afraid they may be left with no choice."
 far_news.7.a:0 "What are they doing so far south?"
 far_news.7.b:0 "Gaoling's metal will serve us well."
 far_news.7.c:0 "Gaoling must be retaken!"
 
 far_news.8.t:0 "The Fall of Omashu"
 far_news.8.d:0 "Omashu, the most powerful city in the southern region, has fallen. With Omashu gone many wonder just how long the rest of the southern region will last. Omashu was always thought to be impenetrable, much like Ba Sing Se, but the Fire Nation has proven this notion to be wrong. The King was captured when the city fell, along with many of his soldiers. The citizens of Omashu were left with nowhere to go, and many began to expect the worst. However, a group of earthbenders managed to create a way out of the city and evacuated as many as they could before the city fell. The question for those survivors is where to go now. Ba Sing Se is thought to be impenetrable, but so was Omashu. Will the Earth Kingdom be able to defend their great city in the end?"
 far_news.8.a:0 "This is a disaster for the Kingdom!"
 far_news.8.b:0 "Someone is getting a promotion."
 far_news.8.c:0 "We have lost the south..."
 
 far_news.9.t:0 "The Fall of Yii"
 far_news.9.d:0 "The town of Yii has fallen to the Fire Nation. Yii was a rather small town, but it commanded a fair amount of resources, particularly metals. These resources likely explain the Fire Nation's desire for the state, otherwise the Fire Nation truly are just hungry for more devastation. Regardless of their goal, the resources will certainly help them continue their war against the Earth Kingdom. Survivors from the town, both soldiers and civilians alike, are hoping to escape to Ba Sing Se behind its impenetrable walls. However, they worry that getting to Ba Sing Se will be more dangerous than submitting to the Fire Nation. As such a good portion of the population have turned themselves over in hopes of only receiving minor punishments."
 far_news.9.a:0 "Does the Fire Nation need more metal?"
 far_news.9.b:0 "Glory to the Fire Lord!"
 far_news.9.c:0 "We must take the back the state!"
 
 far_news.10.t:0 "The Fall of Ba Sing Se"
 far_news.10.d:0 "The great impenetrable walls of Ba Sing Se have fallen. Fire Nation troops now fight with Earth Kingdom soldiers within the streets of the the once unconquerable city. However, with every ring breached, even the palace, it is only a matter of time before the rest of the city falls. A Fire Nation banner now waves at the gates of the Earth King's palace, and the fate of the Earth King is unknown. What little hope remained for the refugees who fled to the great city, is now gone. The Fire Nation have bested the best the Earth Kingdom has to offer. All of the Earth Kingdom soldiers who died hoping to protect their kingdom, have fallen in vein. There is no victory possible for the Earth Kingdom anymore. The Fire Nation has won. The war is over."
